A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/OJXbvdL](https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/OJXbvdL).

100% CSS. No artificial colours or ingredients.

First person to screenshot a lighthouse wins!

This version is slightly cut down to fit in CodePen which still struggles a little. So there are a few bugs... I guess I need to refactor the code a little :)
